# game_base
This is away for me to try and trick myself into learning c++ by attempting to design a simple fantasy game, or at least, some useful functions and modules to base one on.

If the pieces of code that I commit here in the early going seem disjointed or acontextual, many of them will be the results of various tutorial excercises, code snippets and things I'm just trying out to form my thoughts. ***Expect No Cohesion!***, at first at least ;)
